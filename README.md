# Spin-Coater-Automated-System
A spin coater is designed around ramp speed & time parameter to fine tune solar cell coating in a glove box.This system is used to make semiconductor thin films with a centrifugation force. A brushless direct current motor was selected as an actuator, its mathematical model is presented, including the mechanical and electrical dynamics.

It is research Based System & is developed by Arduino Uno.This code is written by Arduino Editor.This system was developed in the BCSIR(Bangladesh Council of scientific & Industrial Research)lab.I was worked in the coding section.
